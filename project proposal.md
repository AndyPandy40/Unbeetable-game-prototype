Project overview 

A tower defence game where swarms of enemies (bees) will try to attack your towers. You will have a maximum of 10 lives. The difficulty will slowly ramp up as the game progresses and hard to kill enemies who have more health and move faster will spawn. 

Each bee you kill will drop gold which can be used to buy upgrades to your towers and buy new towers (to a limit) 

The player will only be able to build towers in set areas determined by each level. 

The player’s money will slowly scale as higher health bees drop more money 

 

Development 

The bees will use a path finding algorithm to path to the end goal in the level.  

An algorithm will be used to increase the difficulty of the game to keep it challenging for the player 

 

 

Programming language 

The game will be programmed using python and the Py game library in an object-oriented way. 

 

Core requirements: 

Bees that spawn in waves and move to an end goal 

The player can buy towers and place them in certain locations to defend against the bees 

There will be a maximum number of lives before you lose to the bees 

 

Extra ideas: 

Power ups – e.g. a fireball to strike the bees etc. 

Reinforcements – troops you can summon on the map to distract the bees 

Suitability 

This project will allow me to show my ability to use pathfinding algorithms such as the A* algorithm to route the bees to the end goal which is an A level topic. 

I will also be writing the code using OOP which will further show my A level programming abilities.
