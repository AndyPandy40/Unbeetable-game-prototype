Analysis


 

A tower defence game where swarms of enemies (bees) will try to attack your towers.  

You will have a maximum of 10 lives.  

The difficulty will slowly ramp up as the game progresses and hard to kill enemies who have more health and move faster will spawn. 

Each bee you kill will drop gold which can be used to buy upgrades to your towers and buy new towers 

The player will only be able to build towers in set areas determined by each level. 

The player’s money will slowly scale as higher health bees drop more money 

 
Clear initial situation

The game starts with an empty path layout.  Towers can be placed until the player runs out of money. Once the player is happy with the layout of the towers, they can choose to let the bees come down the paths. 

 

Clear goal 

Once the bees start spawning the only goal is to kill all of them before they reach the end of the path. If enough bees reach the end of the path and the number of lives remaining goes below one (from 10) then it’s game over and you must reset your progress. 

 

Inputs 

The game will be controlled almost entirely by the mouse. The player will be able to press on the map where they want to place towers and then upgrade these towers by pressing on them again and choosing the upgrade option. The player can also press escape at any point to pause the game. 

 

Clearly defined logic 

The bees will use the A* pathfinding algorithm so that they can path to the end of the track while moving around and avoiding the towers.
